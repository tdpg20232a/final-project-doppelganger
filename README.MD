# Hypothesis: 

- Students using the traditional classroom will have an advantage over the digital twin environments

- Students in the alternate digital twin environment will report higher levels of engagement and satisfaction compared to students in the traditional classroom setting. 

  

# Research Questions: 

- How can we improve the digital twin based on the results of the physical classroom?

- What advantages does the physical classroom have over the digital twin and what can be done to close the gap?

## Research Design: 

- To compare the learning outcomes between traditional classroom settings and digital twin environments, and improve the digital twin based on the physical classroom.

  

## Participant:  

### 10 Student: 

- 5 Students `Tradisional Class` 

- 5 Students `Digital Twins Enviroment` 

- 5 Students in alternate `Digital Twins Enviroment` 

  

## Pre-study Preparation 

- Material Standardization: Audience both groups should be exposed to the same content and materials. 

- Training for Group B: Instruct the students on how to access and utilize the DT platform. 

## Tradisional Class 
The traditional classroom is assumed to be the ideal state and will be used to improve the digital twins environment

## Digital Twins Environment 
Digital twins environment is done simultaneously with the traditional class to have a direct comparison

## Alternate Digital Twins Environment 
An alternate digital twin environment will be deployed to find the impact of the new environment.

## Pre-Test:  

- Test all participants before the learning practice to identify their knowledge concerning the topic and subject areas. 

## Instructor-Led Sessions: 

- The teacher explains the material in a conventional classroom setup 

## Formative Assessments: 

- Periodic quizzes and assessments to gauge ongoing understanding and retention of the material. 

## Interactive learning:  

- This platform includes a visual display feature of the material presented in class 

 

## Post Test: 

- Administer a post-test identical to the pre-test to measure knowledge gains in both groups. 

## Survey & Analysis: 

- Compare pre-test and post-test scores within and between groups. 

- Analysis method .... 

## Result  
- Learning Outcomes: Determine if there is a significant difference in learning outcomes between the three groups. 

- Engagement and Preferences: Assess student engagement and preferences for each learning environment. 

- Implications for Future Teaching: Discuss potential improvements, drawbacks and advantages of integrating digital twin environments in educational settings based on the physical classroom.
